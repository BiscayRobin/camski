# reproduction

I'm using a specific environment and will not change the program to be portable because i want to keep it simple. Also it's important to me that the program only deal with translating picture to ascii. That way anyone can use this ascii output as input to make it's own prettyfier.
To test this i'm using tilix with a custom configuration specified below:

```
custom font: monospace bold
font size: 2
background color: #000000
foreground color: #FFFFFF
transparency: minimum
```
